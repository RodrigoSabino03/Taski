## 📍 Overview

A Taski app helps users manage and organize their tasks by allowing them to add, update, search, and delete tasks. It features task categorization, enabling users to keep track of tasks in different stages such as "Todo," "In Progress," and "Done." Users can add tasks by providing a title, and tasks can be marked as completed or incomplete. The app includes a search function to filter tasks based on their title, and completed tasks can be easily removed from the list. Tasks are displayed in a list format, ensuring a straightforward and user-friendly interface. The app provides a seamless experience for managing daily tasks, keeping users organized, and enabling them to track their progress efficiently.
